# No Sleep

no_sleep is a simple script that pings its list of sites by the given interval.
I've included really basic setup files but you should be able to set it up yourself by installing and running pipenv install.
make sure your in the virtual environment when you run the script
** the setup files assume you have python installed (and pip by extension) **

Update the settings as needed in the file itself and you'll be good to go.
Feel free to update or expand upon the script and create a PR, love to see what you come up with.

You can also setup your computer to run this program automatically with Windows Task Scheduler and Automator, for windows and mac respectively.
I'll let you figure those tools out though.
